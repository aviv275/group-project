# Error Analysis Report

## Overview
This document analyzes misclassifications from our ESG claim analysis models to identify patterns and propose improvements.

## Misclassification Examples

### 1. Environmental Claims Misclassified as Social
**Claim:** "We are committed to achieving 30% renewable energy across our operations by 2026."
**True Label:** Environmental
**Predicted Label:** Social
**Hypothesis:** The phrase "committed to achieving" and "operations" may be associated with social initiatives in the training data.

**Claim:** "Our circular economy strategy diverts 45% of waste from landfill."
**True Label:** Environmental  
**Predicted Label:** Social
**Hypothesis:** "Strategy" and "landfill" terms may have stronger associations with social programs in the dataset.

### 2. Social Claims Misclassified as Environmental
**Claim:** "Employee well-being initiatives yielded a 40% increase in engagement scores this year."
**True Label:** Social
**Predicted Label:** Environmental
**Hypothesis:** The word "initiatives" and percentage metrics may be more commonly associated with environmental claims.

**Claim:** "We achieved gender pay parity across all levels, verified by an independent auditor."
**True Label:** Social
**Predicted Label:** Environmental
**Hypothesis:** "Independent auditor" and verification language may be more prevalent in environmental compliance claims.

### 3. Governance Claims Misclassified as Other
**Claim:** "Our board composition now includes 30% independent directors and 50% women."
**True Label:** Governance
**Predicted Label:** Other
**Hypothesis:** The specific percentages and "board composition" may not be strongly associated with governance in the training data.

**Claim:** "We linked 40% of executive compensation to ESG KPIs for the first time."
**True Label:** Governance
**Predicted Label:** Other
**Hypothesis:** "ESG KPIs" and "executive compensation" may be too generic and not clearly governance-specific.

### 4. Greenwashing Detection Errors

#### False Positives (Legitimate Claims Flagged as Greenwashing)
**Claim:** "We are committed to achieving 30% renewable energy across our operations by 2026."
**True Label:** Legitimate
**Predicted Label:** Greenwashing
**Hypothesis:** Future-tense commitments without immediate measurable results may be flagged as potential greenwashing.

**Claim:** "Our carbon footprint reduction program targets a 45% decrease in emissions within 5 years."
**True Label:** Legitimate
**Predicted Label:** Greenwashing
**Hypothesis:** Long-term targets without current progress indicators may trigger greenwashing detection.

#### False Negatives (Greenwashing Claims Not Detected)
**Claim:** "We incorporated the UN Sustainable Development Goals into our 2030 roadmap."
**True Label:** Greenwashing
**Predicted Label:** Legitimate
**Hypothesis:** Vague, non-specific commitments that sound impressive but lack concrete actions.

**Claim:** "Our updated ESG materiality assessment engaged 5000 stakeholders worldwide."
**True Label:** Greenwashing
**Predicted Label:** Legitimate
**Hypothesis:** Large numbers and professional terminology may mask lack of substantive action.

## Feature Analysis Issues

### 1. Text Length Bias
**Problem:** Very short or very long claims may be misclassified due to insufficient or overwhelming information.
**Example:** Claims under 50 characters or over 200 characters show higher error rates.

### 2. Metric Type Confusion
**Problem:** Similar metric types across categories (e.g., percentages, scores) may cause confusion.
**Example:** "30% renewable energy" vs "30% board diversity" - both use percentages but different categories.

### 3. Temporal Language
**Problem:** Future commitments vs past achievements may not be properly distinguished.
**Example:** "We will achieve" vs "We achieved" may not carry enough weight in the model.

### 4. Geographic Bias
**Problem:** Certain locations may be associated with specific claim types in the training data.
**Example:** Claims from certain countries may be more likely to be classified as environmental regardless of content.

## Proposed Feature Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Text Features
- **Temporal indicators:** Extract and weight future vs past tense language
- **Specificity scores:** Measure claim specificity vs vagueness
- **Action verbs:** Categorize and weight different types of action verbs
- **Quantification:** Better handling of numbers, percentages, and metrics

### 2. Contextual Features
- **Industry context:** Add industry classification for better context
- **Claim maturity:** Distinguish between new vs established initiatives
- **Verification level:** Weight claims with third-party verification higher

### 3. Semantic Features
- **Topic modeling:** Extract latent topics from claim texts
- **Sentiment subcategories:** Break down sentiment into specific dimensions
- **Claim structure:** Analyze claim format and structure patterns

### 4. External Validation Features
- **Validation score weighting:** Give more weight to external validation scores
- **Controversy flag interaction:** Better integration of controversy flags
- **Source credibility:** Weight claims based on source document credibility

## Model Architecture Improvements

### 1. Multi-Task Learning
- Train category and greenwashing detection together to leverage shared information
- Use shared representations while maintaining task-specific heads

### 2. Attention Mechanisms
- Implement attention to focus on key phrases in claims
- Weight different parts of the text based on importance

### 3. Ensemble Methods
- Combine baseline and transformer models
- Use voting or stacking for final predictions

### 4. Domain-Specific Preprocessing
- ESG-specific stop words and terminology
- Custom tokenization for ESG metrics and units
- Industry-specific feature engineering

## Data Quality Improvements

### 1. Balanced Sampling
- Ensure equal representation across categories
- Balance greenwashing vs legitimate claims
- Stratify by organization size and industry

### 2. Data Augmentation
- Generate synthetic claims for underrepresented categories
- Use paraphrasing to increase claim variety
- Add noise to improve robustness

### 3. Annotation Quality
- Multiple annotators for ground truth
- Confidence scores for annotations
- Regular annotation review and updates

## Next Steps

1. **Implement proposed features** in the next model iteration
2. **Collect more diverse data** from different industries and regions
3. **Conduct A/B testing** of different model architectures
4. **Regular error analysis** to track improvement over time
5. **Domain expert review** of misclassification patterns

## Conclusion

The error analysis reveals several systematic issues in our current models:
- Text length and specificity biases
- Temporal language confusion
- Metric type overlap across categories
- Insufficient context awareness

Addressing these issues through the proposed feature improvements and model enhancements should significantly improve classification accuracy and greenwashing detection precision.
